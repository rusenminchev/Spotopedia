The main idea of Spotopedia is to allow the users to discover good places to skate everywhere around the world and get in touch with other individuals with the same interests.
You can easily meet your global and local skate community so you can go skating and have fun together. Everyone can contribute by adding a new spot, posting some cool photos, or useful information to the News Feed. One of the most important things in Rollerblading, Skateboarding, or any other extreme sport is to have fun that is why Spotopedia has a Challenges section. Get motivated and compete with other people around the world to win cool prizes and have fun while doing different challenges.
